		<p> In the 4th chapter, Michael discusses his feelings of not living up to his potential with charlie.Charlie advises him to write down his goals. Tthis serves two purposes: to establish clear goals for himself and writing it down brings it closer to reality. writing down your goals creates a sense of commitment to achieving them. this chapter made me realize that setting my goals down in writing is a form of manifestation and i now look foward to documenting mine. </p>
	
	<p> Chapter 5 explores time management and spending your days wisely. Michael is concerned about not having enough time to get going in the right direction and for his goals, because of his multiple responsibilities. Charlie tells him about choosing between two types of pain:the pain of discipline or the pain of regret. Regret crushes you while discipline is a lighter burden. Many people fall into the trap of spending time on the urgent rather than the importnace of long term of goals.</p>
		
	<p> Charlie talks about how relationships and the people around you influence your life's path.Being around people who posses attributes that you admire is key. I believe that once you start elevating in life and changing your mindset, if the people around you are not aligning with your goals, its better to dissassociate. Surrounding yourself with like minded individuals will inspire you to do better </p>
	
	<p>Chapter 7 focuses on the value of self education and learning for self improvement.Formal education can secure a living but self education will make you a fortune. Charlie suggests reading books written by successful individuals to gain more knowledge. This chapter has inspired me to continue being dedicated to learning and teaching myself even outside of school.This will enhance my knowledge and skills.</p>
