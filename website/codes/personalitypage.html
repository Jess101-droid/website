			<h2> Hello!</h2>
                <p>  My name Janelle, and i absolutely love art, media, literature and technology.These four things has made into me into the person i am today. Whenever i'm not engaged in 		my school work and exploring more about technology,i'm usually off reading russian philosophy books or watching old movies. I spend alot of time by myself because i like 	the peace and quiet. I use this time to self reflect and also for self improvement.These traits have a significant impact on my academic life because i also use this to study. 		</p>

        <h2> Who Inspires me</h2>
        <p> I chose Fyodor Dostoevsky as my hero because he is one of the most influential writers in world literature as he was known for his deep exploration of human 				psychology, existentialism and morality.He penned the quote "But how could you live and have no story to tell?".This simply means that life without 				experiences,challenges or growth seems rather empty and lacks significance. This quote connected with me on a deeper level because it highlights the importance of 			living life with a purpose and making the most of life.</p>

	<p> the test was very interesting and i think it capyures who i am as a person. the test categorized me that i was a guardian. It always good to explore different parts of ourselves and gain insights on who we are as people.</p>
